## What Does Caching Mean?
<br>
Caching is the process of storing data in a cache, which is a temporary storage area that facilitates faster access to data with the goal of improving application and system performance.Cache memory is a type of high-speed volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to a processor and stores frequently used computer programs, applications, and data. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the speed and performance of a computer system.

## Types of Caching.
<br>
**Web Caching**
* Browser caching : Web browsers store copies of web pages, images, and other resources locally to reduce load times on subsequent visits.
The web server collects information from the website and passes it to the web browser. Caching is done depending on whether the user is a first-time visitor or has used the site before.<br>
* Proxy Caching : Proxy servers store copies of web pages and serve them to users, reducing the load on the origin server and speeding up access.<br><br>

**CDN Caching**
* Content Delivery Network (CDN) caching is a critical component in optimizing the performance and efficiency of web applications and websites. A CDN is a network of servers distributed globally, and it aims to deliver web content to users from servers that are geographically closer to them.<br><br>

**Database Caching**
* Database caching is a buffering technique that stores frequently-queried data in temporary memory. A cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data that is often read requested.Implementing a caching strategy on your database can result in improved database performance, availability, and scalability for minimal cost depending on the strategy, all factors contributing to an overall positive application experience.<br><br>
